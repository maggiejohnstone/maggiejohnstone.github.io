            The ORA website was built as a landing page for potential and current ORA users.  I created this five-page site, a few graphics, and photographed many images used on the website.  They had already established their site on Shopify and I worked inside the CMS environment to modify it.  I customized a lot of the CSS code to get the look they wanted.  I worked directly with the founder & CEO.
